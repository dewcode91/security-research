# CVE-2025-65380

**Summary:**

Web app contains a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/admin/index.php ` endpoint. The `username` parameters accept user-supplied input which is concatenated directly into a backend SQL query without proper validation or parameterization. An attacker can supply crafted input to manipulate the SQL statement executed by the database.

**Affected Versions:**  
- Billing System 1.0 

**Vulnerability Details:**  

The `index.php` page is vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLi) because the user inputs `username` are taken directly from the `$_POST` array and concatenated into the database query string without proper sanitization.

**Impact:**  

A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to bypass authentication, retrieve unauthorized data from the database, or potentially compromise the entire application's database integrity.
